Description:
This project is to develop an Android Mobile App to access the learning material of this
course. The mobile app should mimic the organization of the course material in the same
modular way as in the D2L web course system. The specifications include:
1) A top-level module “Start Here” with sub-modules:
  a. “Welcome”
  b. “Syllabus”
  c. “Lab Report Instruction”
  d. “Project Instruction”
2) Another top-level module, “Learning Modules”, with 13 lesson sub-modules, and
each sub-module has two children sub-modules:
  a. “Slides”
  b. “Lab”
3) User registration and authentication (This can be implemented as the last step since
we will talk about the data and security in the last week, but you are highly
encouraged to do your research to have it done in advance.)

You are allowed to be creative in the UI designs.
